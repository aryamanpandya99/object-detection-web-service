# Production Deep Learning 

This project will implement a simple deep learning system tasked with classifying frames from a video. The video will be uploaded to a server, which will then run a classification model and store the results in a database. 

The goal of this project is to get familiarized with tools and infrastructure frameworks used to deploy and maintain production ML systems. This project is part 1 of a larger production ML self-study effort.
